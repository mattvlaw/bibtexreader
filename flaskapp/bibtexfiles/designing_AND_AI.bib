abstract = {This article critically interrogates how participation is practiced during the design process. We present the findings of three different configurations of participatory design workshops, each involving a different stakeholder group (age researchers, care experts and older adults). Building on insights from Science and Technology Studies (STS), we reveal how, in design practice, different configurations of participation enact and materialize multiple versions of ageing. To refer to this ontological layer of design processes, we introduce the concept “design multiple”. Our study adds to current debates on the practices of participatory design and STS, as it shows how different configurations multiply enact objects into several material realities. We raise awareness on the practices of configuring participatory design, and their ontological consequences}

This implies that there can be no single ‘design science’. The paper also casts doubt on whether a design science, if it did exist, would be useful in the sense of helping to produce better or quicker designs. This entails a short discussion of the distinction between ‘complete’, ‘closed’ and ‘adequate’ theories. The paper concludes with explicit recommendations to make future designs better and to improve the effectiveness of design processes by enabling design ‘shared memory’. These recommendations follow directly from the strong limits imposed by the proposition that there is no single science of design.}

However, mechatronics design is a complex activity involving the different fields of mechanics, electronics and software, and the article suggests that new design models describing the total mechatronic product in the initial design phases are needed.

Experience gained from the application of KBS technology suggests that the incorporation of higher levels of knowledge will result in more powerful, usable and intelligent computer systems. The power of such intelligent systems will clearly depend on the quality and depth of knowledge on which they are based. It is argued that the most direct and accurate source of such information is provided by the domain expert. However, the transference of expert understanding remains the difficult problem of knowledge elicitation. This paper argues that thorough knowledge elicitation procedures in the domain of design are needed to enable the development of more powerful ICAD systems. An important concept arising from the use of KBS technology is the value of a human communicable understanding of the domain, in terms of a testable, machine independent model of cognition. In this paper we describe a method of knowledge elicitation that has been applied in the domain of page layout design. Using the results of this method an elaborate model of the page layout design has been successfully developed. It is argued that this study demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of applying knowledge acquisition techniques to design tasks.}

At the action-execution level, analogies are used in order to solve the current design problem; at the action-management level, in order to make the action-execution process cognitively more economical. Differences between the uses concern their dependence on the routine character of the task, the distance between target and source, and their link with creativity and reuse (or case-based reasoning).}

The method presented in this paper is a combination of the methods proposed by Pugh and by Mistree and Muster. The former method is appropriate for use in concept selection, which is characterized by many alternatives and essentially insight-based ‘soft’ information. The latter method is appropriate when there are few alternatives and a mix of science-based ‘hard’ and insight-based ‘soft’ information.

Empirical observations were made on over 130 architectural students/practitioners viewing a variety of architectural videos. Our findings show the learning style of the viewer markedly affects the way they perceive information. Thus, effective communication is best achieved when the producer of a message is aware of the perceptual/learning needs of the viewer and caters to those needs in their communication processes. Through a working knowledge of a fourfold model of learning it is possible for individuals of different cognitive styles to communicate more effectively with one another. The same knowledge can also be used in the production of videos so that they might communicate better to different audiences. To aid this communication process the authors have developed an Architectural Video Narrative Model which enables a better understanding of video communication to architectural designers. This model presents alternative narratively ‘logical’ ways in which communicating video design might develop. The model also allows the designer of video sequences to contemplate or consider different narrative strategies. This should help them tell the same story in a relevant fourfold of ways.}

The distinction between innovative design and design by modification results only from the quality and nature of the prototypes and modifications involved.}

In order to do this effectively it commences with a definition of a core design activity in relation to products which are either conventional or novel. KBS are broken down in sympathy with the decomposition of a design, i.e., whole design, partial or sub-system design, component design. The problem of knowledge elicitation and the variability of the constraints at each level of design are considered and conclusions drawn in terms of conventional and novel products. A hypothesis—‘to be or not to be’—is proposed covering the conceptual design spectrum which suggests that the way forward is via a system of linked KMs (knowledge modules) to be designed using multi-disciplinary teams, since it is considered that KBS are products in their own right and should be treated as such.}

abstract = {The hermeneutical philosophy of Gadamer and Heidegger and the pragmatism of Dewey are brought to bear in arguing against the view that designing involves a special kind of knowledge that is fundamentally difficult to grasp and therefore mysterious. The hermeneutical thesis maintains that understanding is acquired in a manner best described in terms of bringing expectations to bear on a situation. These expectations are derived from our effective historical consciousness and are constantly being renewed as we respond to situations. This mode of thinking is the only way of thinking, whether we are solving a mathematical problem or creating a work of art. Not withstanding this ‘common sense’ understanding, claims for the mystery of designing persist. These claims are examined in turn in the light of a hermeneutical understanding of thought. They include the dual knowledge thesis, the more fundamental notion of the thinking subject isolated from the world of objects, and the subjectivism of the Romantic movement that is evident in writings about the genius loci. There is then a consideration of the sense in which it is appropriate to talk about designing as being different to other activities and how this impinges on design teaching and practice. The argument is presented that when mystery is removed then effective dialogue, and hence learning, can ensue.}

However, in order to be considered useful it seems clear that such methods should not only be able to provide an accurate description of the design process, but must also leave the nature of that process largely unaffected. This paper presents empirical findings which challenge both of these assumptions. Experimental work is presented which suggests that concurrent verbal descriptions of a design activity may not map well onto the behaviour that such descriptions are intended to characterize. Secondly, the findings presented here suggest that having to describe the design activity may affect the design process itself. This paper suggests that design descriptions are not only mediated by cognitive limitations but also grounded in the conventions of practice surrounding design activities.}

abstract = {This paper reflects upon the emerging uses of ethnography in engineering and systems design. Although ethnography is often equated simply with fieldwork, a driving force in the early development of classical ethnography was to provide accounts for what is observed in terms of a priori anthropological and sociological theories. Recent studies of collaborative work systems informed by ethnomethodology have exposed the shortcomings of classical ethnography, and have shifted the emphasis of fieldwork towards describing the accountable practices through which those in work constitute and organise their joint activity. However, a second wave of fieldwork-based studies of work systems and design is now gaining force that threatens to dilute this analytic emphasis. Using examples drawn from the production printing industry, I argue that recent examples of scenic fieldwork—fieldwork that merely describes and codifies what relevant persons do in the workplace—may well be missing out on the constitutive practices of how they do what they do, the `interactional what' of their activities. Rather than ethnography, or even fieldwork itself, it is the explication of members' knowledge—what people have to know to do work, and how that knowledge is deployed in the ordering and organisation of work—that provides the key to understanding the contribution of sociology to engineering and design.}

The procedures underlying generic descriptive models of creative design are used to provide further insight into the example.

Moreover, the team leader often initiated this co-evolution. Co-evolution episodes linked with other creative activities such as analogising and mental simulation and there was a clear association between co-evolution and expressions of epistemic uncertainty, suggesting that designers were dealing with considerable complexity and ambiguity. Our findings support the view that co-evolution is the ‘engine’ of creativity in collaborative design.}

The Think-Maps framework proposes that by constructing a conceptual map that reflects one’s thinking in a domain, we make explicit the knowledge learned. The learner constructs structured representations of concepts and their relationships to other concepts and fills these structures with the content of the specific design domain or design task. This resulting structured representation of knowledge can later be accessed and expanded in additional processes of design thinking. Web-Pad — a computational tool that implements these ideas is presented and illustrated. Web-Pad is used for organizing and representing conceptual maps of a specific domain.

But, Peirce subsumes two different patterns under the name ‘abduction’: explanatory abduction and innovative abduction. What is usually understood by ‘abduction’ in the context of design theory and knowledge-based design systems, appears to be explanatory abduction. However, the reasoning towards new solutions for design problems follows the pattern of Peirce's innovative abduction. So, automating design requires the modelling of innovative abduction.

abstract = {Computers are being integrated into the technological design process, just as they are being integrated into banking practice, airline reservations, and many other activities. Until now, computers have served as tools used by designers in methods dictated by the paper-based information systems to which humanity has become accustomed. Computers perform design calculations or analyses, and produce documentation such as drawings, schedules, specifications, and tapes to control production machines. However, as more technical information is stored in computer memories, and as the communication networks between computers develop, different working methods, adapted to electronics-based rather than paper-based information systems, may develop. This paper explores briefly the process of design, and then, using some concepts published in the last few years, proposes a model of the design process that can be implemented by computer. Emphasis is placed on the ‘frame’ concept with a final reference to recent research in artificial intelligence. The paper does not attempt to give a comprehensive survey of the subject of problem solving in engineering design. Furthermore, the ideas expressed have not yet been used to create a working design program. The examples used as illustrations of various concepts are therefore only partial.}

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the core themes of design research by analysing citations of papers in the journal Design Studies. It also aims to find out the evolution and future trends of design research.
Methodology
Employing a bibliometrics and network analysis, the paper analyses citations and co-citations from Design Studies. Instead of using the standard analysis method of aggregating author co-citations, this study conducts the analysis at the individual publication level.
Research limitations/recommendations
Due to the limitation of the Scopus database, this study only managed to extract articles with full citations in Design Studies from 1996 to 2010. Further studies could also include articles from 1979 to 1995 by either using some character recognition software or manually extracting them.
Findings
The study identifies the core themes centered on design process and design cognition. In addition, it also reveals that the research method protocol analysis has become more popular in recent years among researchers.
Originality/value
The main contribution of this paper is the use of a network analysis technique to analyse 12 107 citations in the 459 articles published in Design Studies between 1996 and 2010. Unlike previous review papers which relied heavily on the qualitative observations and reflections of the authors, this paper is the first comprehensive quantitative analysis in this field.}

In the knitwear design process, the communication between knitwear designers and technicians has been identified in an empirical study as a major bottleneck. While knitwear is inherently difficult to communicate, the design culture does little ease the problem. This paper argues that an intelligent design support system allows the designers to turn their typically incomplete, inconsistent and inaccurate specification of designs into a correct representation of their ideas, thus reducing the interpretation by technicians as well as the design time. This can be achieved by automatically creating design solution suggestions based on the designers' customary specifications. This principle has been illustrated for the construction of garment shapes, which were modeled mathematically.}

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to explore the cognitive mechanisms involved in architectural design problem solving. Special attention is given to how design constraints operate throughout the whole process. A proposed cognitive model describes the general cognitive procedure. Schema theory applied from cognitive psychology stimulates the representation of domain-specific knowledhe. The application of production system detects the control strategy, and a laboratory experiment of a residential design is conducted for protocol analysis. Evidence collected from the analysis yields two results. First, that design solutions are generated by means of activating the design constraints and associated rules in memory. Second, that the design ability is determined by the ability to select rules in schema as well as the ability to develop new schema to test newly generated design units.}

abstract = {Design can be regarded as a seeing–moving–seeing process, where designers repeatedly see and generate ideas that are based on what they have done. The crucial point of design thinking is how designers recognize ambiguous shapes from sketches and then transfer them into different shapes. This study attempts to conduct cognitive experiments to elucidate the sketching process and to simulate two types of sketching behavior used by neural network systems. When exhibiting the first type of sketching behavior, designers are able to transform their original sketches to satisfy requirements. Simulating this type of visual cognitive behavior by neural networks could help computers modify shapes to meet design requirements, as human designers do. When demonstrating the second type of sketching behavior, designers are able to see an ambiguous shape as different complete shapes so as to associate divergent design ideas. Another set of neural networks investigated in this study could also associate different shapes by adjusting the TSL and produce different idea sketches from the same shape.}

However, DESMATE is also a tool capable of both tracking the detailed activities of an engineer working within the design environment and of subsequently analysing the resulting activity traces. At present DESMATE is being used to collect traces of individual expert and novice engineers pursuing a high-level design from a given requirements' specification. Some preliminary data are presented here and discussed in relation to existing models of design processes. In addition, the broader potential applications of DESMATE are highlighted, including its use as (i) a metric for assessing design technique and capability and (ii) an intelligent training aid for educating student engineers about different design strategies.}

Aspects of the process to get from problem space to solution space can be captured with design models, but in considering the ‘jump’ from solution space to problem space we enter largely uncharted territory.}

An interpretation is formed when design moves, which are enacted on knowledge pertaining to the task, transform its pieces into a stable structure by achieving a unique relationship among them. A look at first-year students' design efforts demonstrates how, through construing the task, interpretations are not generated. The potential for creating global interpretations is likely to be found mostly at the starting point, which reflects the designer's state of mind at the outset of the desing endeavour. Different ways in which experimentation is carried out are analysed, notably play and discovery, without which it is hard to imagine a process of composition of pieces of knowledge. Play and discovery are shown to induce new interpretations and to help substantiate old ones. The contribution of long chains of moves and the timely generation and evaluation of design criteria and constraints is pointed out. These different cognitive aspects reveal how central an activity interpreting is throughout the entire process of architectural designing.}

A Heideggerian view displaces computation as the basis of understanding. In this article the workings of metaphor are posited as the bases of an alternative understanding of design.

abstract = {A new logic scheme called recursive logic is proposed, which is different from the widely accepted logics: deductive logic, inductive logic and abductive logic. It is suggested that recursive logic is the logic of design. The rationality of this proposal is then discussed based on the investigation of the facets of design activity. Finally, it is pointed out that many well-known design methodologies such as the pattern language given by Alexander can find their explanations in this logic scheme.}

abstract = {The long-term aim of this research is to develop a method to index design knowledge that is intuitive to an engineering designer and therefore encourage the reuse of information. Eighteen interviews were carried out to understand how designers described the process of designing a particular component or assembly. The analysis led to the development of a method of indexing design knowledge, which has been evaluated in two stages: (1) evaluation of individual taxonomies within the method; and (2) indexing of 92 reports using the method. The research contributes to the development of an ontology for engineering design.}

abstract = {Although effort to use expert systems in design goes back a long way, widespread awareness of promise has emerged in the last five years. Grasp of the content of design is poor among knowledge engineers. Generally, the effort has had to come from designers. Although selection scheme ‘shells’ have short-term promise the construction of major design support procedures contains many problems. Relevant papers are reviewed. Possible lines of development are suggested. Expertise — called knowledge — has to be brought together, covering data, value schemes, meta-knowledge, strategies, etc. Conclusions are offered, with some key messages for various audiences.}

abstract = {The ability to design is widespread amongst all people, but some people appear to be better designers than others. This paper addresses what we know about this `natural intelligence' of design ability, and the nature of design activity. Quotations and comments from some acknowledged expert designers are used to reinforce general findings about the nature of design activity that have come from recent design research. The role of sketching in design is used to exemplify some of the complexity of designing. In conclusion, comments are made about the value and relevance of research into artificial intelligence (AI) in design. It is suggested that one aim of research in AI in design should be to help inform understanding of the natural intelligence of design ability.}

abstract = {An interpretivist perspective on the study of design makes demands of methods and representational formalisms which are different from those valued from an analytical perspective. Ways of studying and describing design are presented which are consistent with the view that the process by which we come to understand design as a social activity is, in essence, a work of interpretation. A unifying methodological basis for studying and describing design is proposed. Using examples from a case study, two complementary forms of description are presented. The interpretation they represent respects the inseparability of conceiving and evaluating possible design solutions, the process of designing, and the justification of design proposals.}

Drawing on insights from Freud, hermeneutical theorists, and games themselves, we focus on repetition, its variation, and the matter of the ethical in computer games. The essay is concerned less with resolving the ethical questions posed than showing that the ethical also succumbs to the rule of play. Play is at work in design, the computer game and the realm of the ethical.}

A central feature of the information model is the use of object-oriented modelling techniques to allow information to be viewed from different ‘perspectives’ and at different levels of abstraction, according to the requirements of the user. This paper discusses the object modelling of concepts and information in the design area. Drawing on knowledge elicited from protocol analysis of the design activity, a series of interrelated object models has been developed, reflecting different perspectives and abstraction levels within the design domain. Three of these models (spatial design, physical design and structural design) are presented and their implications for the communication and sharing of information discussed.}
