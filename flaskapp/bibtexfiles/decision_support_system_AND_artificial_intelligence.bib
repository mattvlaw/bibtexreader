abstract = {Technical teaching at universities has not successfully integrated recent advances in cognitive sciences, design studies and information technology into design education. Since industry needs engineers that are immediately productive and creative, universities are revising their priorities in order to improve the decision making skills of future engineers. In this paper, knowledge from multiple sources, a navigation framework and specially developed interactive features are integrated into FIBRES. FIBRES is a decision making pilot software for design education in the area of bridge engineering. To help students learn productive and creative multi-strategy design, it is best to delay introducing case-based strategies.}

abstract = {In this pilot study, two different ways of presenting information for industrial design students on the psychological aspects of the design of a go-cart were compared. The search for information from external sources and the use of this information in different phases of the design process were also studied. In the control group, students were only given general information on six psychological topics of their design problem, while in the experimental group, students received more detailed information using verbal and visual examples. In this way and by stimulating the students to actively ‘work’ with the information, proceduralization of the transferred declarative knowledge was supposed to take place. Analysis of the students' reports describing their design process, information sources and decisions, showed that play-information was mainly used in the information phase of the design process. The main difference between the control and experimental groups was that students from the experimental group mentioned more specific information on play activities in their reports, while the control group mentioned more general information on the attitudes and taste of the users. Comparison of the prototypes, working models of the go-cart, showed that the experimental group scored significantly higher on three child-related aspects: the carts trigger the child's fantasy, are multifunctional and are more suitable for social play-activities. On the other hand, the go-carts of the control group were judged to be more suitable for older children. These differences between the two groups cannot be explained by differences in design ability as measured by the educational staff, but appear to be related to the differences in conditions.}

abstract = {The discovery of a creative solution occasionally corresponds to the sudden attainment of a mental insight. Our purpose is to formally describe this phenomenon and the cognitive mechanisms that lead to it. The approach is based on the replicability of just such an insight which underlies the solution to a well known puzzle: the nine-dot puzzle. The insight coincides with the realization that the problem can only be solved when a spurious constraint is removed. Two experimental results are reported: one on the nine-dot puzzle and the other on an architectural sketch design problem. The sketch design problem was structured with several restricting frames of reference to create a situation analogous to the nine-dot puzzle. Subjects' design behaviour was analysed to identify the mechanisms used in achieving the mental insights which allow designers to go beyond the implicit restrictions of these frames. A general model, called SMI-GI, of the mental insight based design and discovery process is described. This model foresees a computer system that can be used to simulate the mental insight mechanism and consequently lead to the systematic examination of this aspect of design creativity.}

abstract = {This paper reports two studies of the design process within engineering firms. The studies were based on participant-observation techniques: in each case the firm was approached in the way an ethnographer might approach a foreign culture. The paper presents and discusses observations of typical activities that occur in the design process. In particular, design is observed as a social process. Three types of discourse are identified: constraining, naming and deciding.}
